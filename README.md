## Personal Use

This is intended for my personal use, but if you want to see someone struggle with learning, at least you'll know that you are not alone.

It's also nice for Future Me to see what I may have struggled with in the past, in case I need to revisit/re-learn something. :-)

## Installation notes on Windows

Manual installation which involves downloading the `exercism.exe` binary and copying it into `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps"`

I check out my "exercism" GitHub repo and set `exercism configure --workspace <path-to-my-exercism-github-repo-locally>`. For example:

```bash
exercism configure --workspace "C:\Users\Steve.Bonds\github.com\exercism"
```
