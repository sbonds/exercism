When running the test on a blank file I got:

Run options: --verbose --seed 31110

This line:

Suggests we need a class "TwoFerTest" with a method TwoFer

New error:

Based on Google search

This means we have a duplicate class. Perhaps taking "Test" off the end is what we want.
Seems a bit vague though...

New error:

  1) Error:
TwoFerTest#test_no_name_given:
NoMethodError: undefined method `two_fer' for TwoFer:Class
    two-fer/two_fer_test.rb:8:in `test_no_name_given'

That implies we're looking to define that undefined method. Consider it done!

Hmm... still undefined. Maybe it needs to be a class method instead of an
instance method?

Hey, that was it! New error:

  1) Failure:
TwoFerTest#test_no_name_given [two-fer/two_fer_test.rb:8]:
Expected: "One for you, one for me."
  Actual: nil

This was expected since I haven't actually returned anything yet.

One test worked, the others were skipped. Why skipped?

Maybe I need to have a method that takes a parameter for the name?

Nope, now it gets mad when called without an argument.

Based on

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1108612/method-with-same-name-and-different-parameters-in-ruby

"Ruby doesn't really support overloading"

Try one method with one arg and set the name equal to "you" if it shows up false-ish

Still fails, same error:

  TwoFerTest#test_no_name_given:
  ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1)
      C:/Users/sbonds/git/ruby-learning/exercism.io/two-fer/two_fer.rb:109:in `two_fer'

Making parameters optional:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35747905/a-method-with-an-optional-parameter

Using "name = nil" worked nicely.

One test passed, two tests skipped. Why skipped?

OK, I finally broke down and looked at the test code itself rather than just its
output. It appears that the tests are skipped explicitly (not based on a
dependency of some earlier test passing.)

I commented out the 'skip' lines and all three tests pass.

class TwoFer
  def self.two_fer(name = 'you')
    "One for #{name}, one for me."
